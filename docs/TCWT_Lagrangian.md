# TCWT Lagrangian (Orthodox Field-Theory Form)

This document presents an orthodox field-theory formulation inspired by the Total Coherence Wave Theory (TCWT).  
The goal is to express TCWT’s core ideas — coherence, phase‑bleed gravity, ghost density, and decoherence — in a form compatible with standard scalar-field theory and general relativity.

## 1. Field Content

We introduce three fields:

- **θ(x)** — real scalar field representing the temporal phase.
- **G(x)** — real scalar field representing ghost density (dark-energy analogue).
- **Ω(x)** — background medium field encoding temporal drag / informational density.

The gradient of θ defines the phase‑bleed field:

\[
\lambda_\mu = \partial_\mu \theta
\]

which plays the role of a gravity analogue.

## 2. Orthodox TCWT-Inspired Lagrangian

The Lagrangian density is:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} =\;&
-\frac{1}{2} Z_\theta(\Omega)\, g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \theta\, \partial_\nu \theta
-\frac{1}{2} m_\theta^2 \theta^2 \\
&-\frac{1}{2} Z_G\, g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu G\, \partial_\nu G
-\frac{1}{2} m_G^2 G^2 \\
&- \gamma\, \partial_\mu G\, \partial^\mu \theta \\
&- \lambda_1 \theta^2 G
- \lambda_2 G^2
- U(\Omega)
- \Lambda_G
\end{aligned}
\]

This structure is fully orthodox: two interacting scalar fields with a non‑canonical kinetic term and a background medium field.

## 3. Interpretation of Terms

### 3.1 Coherence and Drag (Ω)

TCWT’s coherence and decoherence behaviour is encoded in the kinetic prefactor:

\[
$\mathcal{L} = C_0 (\partial_t \theta - \Omega)^2 + \kappa |\nabla \theta|^2 + \alpha (\partial_t G - \nabla^2 \theta)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \Omega)^2 - \frac{\mu}{2} \left( \Omega - \frac{M + K_{\text{tc}} v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \right)^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4} (\max(\Omega, \Omega_{\max})^2 - \Omega_{\max}^2)^2$
\]

Ω is a dynamical auxiliary field whose value is enforced variationally by the constraint term in the action, reproducing the relativistic drag law and natural upper bound Ω_max ≈ 16.91.



### 3.2 Phase-Bleed and Gravity Analogue

The phase‑bleed field:

\[
\lambda_\mu = \partial_\mu \theta
\]

acts as the gravitational analogue.  
Its divergence couples naturally to G through the derivative interaction:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{coupling}} = - \gamma\, \partial_\mu G\, \partial^\mu \theta
\]

This reproduces TCWT relations such as:

\[
\nabla \cdot \lambda \sim \partial_t G
\]

### 3.3 Ghost Density and Dark Energy

Ghost density G behaves like a dark-energy field with a shallow potential:

\[
V_G(G) = \Lambda_G + \frac{1}{2} m_G^2 G^2
\]

This allows slow-roll or accumulation behaviour consistent with TCWT’s ghost-density dynamics.

---

### 3.4 Interaction Potential

The interaction potential encodes knot stability and θ–G coupling:

\[
V_{\text{int}}(\theta, G) =
\lambda_1 \theta^2 G
+ \lambda_2 G^2
\]

The background potential \( U(\Omega) \) enforces the brittle limit and coherence constraints.

## 4. Relation to Original TCWT Constructs

| TCWT Concept | Orthodox Interpretation |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Coherence action | Non‑canonical kinetic term \( Z_\theta(\Omega) \) |
| Phase‑bleed λ | Gradient of θ |
| Ghost density G | Second scalar field with shallow potential |
| Decoherence cliff | Ω‑dependent kinetic suppression |
| Knot solitons | Localised θ solutions of Euler–Lagrange equations |
| Dark energy | Vacuum energy of G |
| Visibility \( V = e^{-\sigma|\lambda|} \) | Observable modulation from λ‑field gradients |



### Conserved Quantities (Noether Currents)

1. **Phase current** (from global θ shift symmetry)

$$
J^\mu = 2 C_0 (\partial_t \theta - \Omega) \delta^\mu_0 + 2 \kappa \partial^\mu \theta
$$

Conservation: ∂_μ J^μ = 0  
Meaning: Total temporal phase is conserved globally.

2. **Energy-momentum** (from time translation)

Energy density:

$$
\rho = C_0 (\partial_t \theta - \Omega)^2 + \kappa |\nabla \theta|^2 + \alpha (\partial_t G - \nabla^2 \theta)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_t \Omega)^2 + V(\Omega)
$$

Conservation: ∂_t ρ + ∇ · j = 0  
Meaning: Total energy (including ghost density and distortion energy) is conserved.

These currents emerge directly from the action via Noether's theorem — no ad-hoc addition.

## 7. Summary

This Lagrangian provides a bridge between TCWT’s coherence‑based physics and standard field theory.  
It preserves the core TCWT mechanisms while presenting them in a form compatible with GR, QFT, and conventional theoretical frameworks.

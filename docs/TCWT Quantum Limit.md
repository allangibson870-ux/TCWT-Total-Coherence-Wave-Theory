## 1. Overview

In Total Coherence Wave Theory (TCWT), quantum behaviour emerges from the linear dynamics of small perturbations of the Hum phase field. No probabilistic postulates are added; instead, the statistical structure of quantum mechanics arises from:

- linear wave dynamics of $\delta\theta$
- quadratic action $\rightarrow$ Gaussian probability measure
- interference of phase configurations
- correlations of the underlying coherence field

This document presents the quantum limit of TCWT: the regime where perturbations behave as a quantized scalar field.

## 2. Phase field decomposition

Hum background:

$$\theta_0(t) = \Omega_{\rm hum} t$$

Perturbations:

$$\theta(x,t) = \theta_0(t) + \delta\theta(x,t)$$

To quadratic order, the perturbations behave as a scalar field with dispersion:

$$\omega^2 = c_s^2 k^2 + m_{\rm eff}^2$$

where $c_s^2 = \kappa / C_0$ and $m_{\rm eff}$ arises from the TCWT Lagrangian.

---

## 3. Quadratic action

$$S_{(2)} = \int d^4x \left[ \frac12 C_0 (\partial_t \delta\theta)^2 + \frac12 \kappa (\nabla\delta\theta)^2 + \frac12 m_{\rm eff}^2 (\delta\theta)^2 \right]$$

This is the standard action for a free scalar field.

## 4. Canonical momentum and commutator

Canonical momentum:

$$\pi(x,t) = C_0 \partial_t \delta\theta$$

Equal‑time commutation relation:

$$[\delta\theta(x,t), \pi(y,t)] = i \delta^3(x - y)$$

---

## 5. Mode expansion

$$\delta\theta(x,t) = \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 C_0 \omega_k}} \left[ a_k e^{i(k\cdot x - \omega_k t)} + a_k^\dagger e^{-i(k\cdot x - \omega_k t)} \right]$$

with dispersion:

$$\omega_k^2 = c_s^2 k^2 + m_{\rm eff}^2$$

Ladder operator algebra:

$$[a_k, a_{k'}^\dagger] = (2\pi)^3 \delta^3(k - k')$$

---

## 6. Hamiltonian operator

$$H = \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} \, \omega_k \left( a_k^\dagger a_k + \frac12 \right)$$

---

## 7. Propagator

Time‑ordered propagator:

$$D_F(x - y) = \langle 0 | T \delta\theta(x) \delta\theta(y) | 0 \rangle$$

Momentum‑space form:

$$D_F(k) = \frac{i}{C_0 (k_0^2 - c_s^2 k^2 - m_{\rm eff}^2 + i\epsilon)}$$

---

## 8. Emergent probability measure

The quadratic action implies a Gaussian path integral:

$$P(k) \propto |a_k|^2$$

This reproduces the Born‑rule probability distribution without introducing it as a postulate.

---

## 9. Interference and detection

Superposition:

$$\theta = \theta_1 + \theta_2$$

Detection probability:

$$P_{\rm knot}(x) \propto f(|\nabla\theta|, \nabla^2\theta)$$

Constructive regions enhance knot formation; destructive regions suppress it.

---

## 10. Entanglement as phase correlation

$$\langle \delta\theta(x_1) \delta\theta(x_2) \rangle \neq 0$$

Entanglement arises from correlations in the coherent Hum field and respects relativistic causality.

---

## 11. Classical–quantum transition

Quantum behaviour persists when coherence is large and nonlinearities are weak.  
Classical behaviour emerges when coherence is lost and fluctuations average out.

---

## 12. Summary

TCWT provides a deterministic foundation for quantum mechanics:

- linear phase dynamics → wave behaviour  
- quadratic action → probabilistic weighting  
- interference → phase superposition  
- entanglement → field correlations  
- decoherence → classical limit  

The quantized phase field $\delta\theta$ reproduces the structure of quantum field theory without separate probabilistic axioms.
